# ASSIGNMENT 1

## Question 1
- [2.5 marks] Read 3 files for red, green, and unknown data sets
- For each unknown sample in the unknown data set
  - [2.5 marks] Calculate distances from the unknown sample to all red data samples
  - [2.5 marks] Find min_1 (minimum distance of the above distances to red samples)
  - [2.5marks]Calculatedistancesfromtheunknownsampletoallbluedatasamples
  - [2.5 marks] Find min_2 (minimum distance of the above distances to blue samples) o [2.5 marks] Compare min_1 and min_2 and assign class label to the unknown sample
- [2.5 marks] Output all unknown samples and their class label to screen
- [2.5 marks] Output all unknown samples and their class label to file
- [2.5 marks] Data sample is tuple, red, blue and unknown data samples are stored in 3 lists
- [2.5 marks] All functions are in a module file, no function is in main program
- [2.5 marks] Exception handling
- [2.5 marks] Overall
- [– 10 marks] The program cannot work with any number of dimensions
- [– 10 marks] External packages imported (except tkinter)
- [– 10 marks] Algorithm is quite different from the given algorithm
- [– 10 marks] There are no comments that explain your code

## Question 2
- [6 marks] Read data file, get number of dimensions D and number of data samples N
- [6 marks] Input number of clusters K, create K clusters same dimension D at random, and
set threshold to a small value
- Repeat the following:
  - [6 marks] For each data sample, find its nearest cluster centre
  - [6marks]Groupdatasampleshavingthesamenearestcentretoacluster
  - [6 marks] For each cluster, calculate new cluster centre (average of all samples) o [6marks]Calculatesumofdistancesbetweenoldandnewclustercentres
  - [6 marks] If the sum is less than the threshold: display K cluster centres and data
  samples on canvas then break, else: set cluster centres to new cluster centres
- [6 marks] Data sample is tuple, all data samples are stored in a list
- [6 marks] All functions are in a module file, no function is in main program
- [6 marks] Exception handling
- [10 marks] Overall (Output on canvas and Python code writing)
- [– 20 marks] The program cannot work with any number of dimensions
- [– 20 marks] External packages imported (except tkinter)
- [– 20 marks] Algorithm is quite different from the given algorithm
- [– 20 marks] There are no comments that explain your code
